# my money keeper

In the past year, I have been used Numbers for bookkeeping. Numbers is a good tool, but it's not that convenient. So I am strugglling to develop a wechat miniprogram now. I hope in the developing process I can learn a lot of knowledges, and in the end, I can use this new tool for my bookkeeping.

## how to use
Use your wechat to scan this QR code


## for developers
